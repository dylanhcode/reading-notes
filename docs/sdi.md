### Chapter 1: Scale From Zero to Millions of Users


<details>
  <summary><strong>Goal</strong></summary>

- build a system that supports a **single user** => **millions of users**

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Single server setup</strong></summary>

- Web app:
    - backend: Java, Python, etc
        - handle business logic, storage, etc.
    - frontend: HTML, JavaScript
        - presentation
- Mobile app:
    - communication: HTTP
    - API response format: most commonly used JSON

<details>
  <summary><strong>Database</strong></summary>

- with increasing users, we need multiple servers: one for web/mobile traffic, the other for the DB.  
    - Separating web/mobile traffic (web tier) and database (data tier) servers allows them to be scaled independently.

</p>

- **Which database to use?**
    - Relational DB
        - relational database management system (RDBMS) or SQL database
        - e.g. MySQL, Oracle DB, PostgreSQL, etc.
        - relational DB represent and store data in tables and rows
        - can perform join operations
    - Non-relational DB
        - NoSQL database
        - e.g. CounchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, HBase, Amazon DynamoDB, etc.
        - 4 Categories
            - key-value stores
            - graph stores
            - column stores
            - document stores
        - Join operations not supported
    - Non-relational DB might be the right choice if:
        - requires super-low latency
        - data are unstructed, or do not have any relational data (data that is organized into tables / also called relations)
        - only need to serialize and deserialize data (text-based data format such as JSON, XML, YAML, etc)

  <summary><strong>Load balancer (Web Tier)</strong></summary>

- Users/clients connect to the public IP of the load balancer directly => load balancer connects to the web servers via private IPs* (*: IP addr only reachable between servers in the same network).
    - web servers are unreachable directly by clients for better security.

</p>

- Benefits:
    - solved no-failover* (*: a system lacks the ability to automatically switch to a backup or redundant system when the primary system fails or becomes unavailable) issue.
        - if one server goes offline, all the traffic will be routed to the other server => prevent the website from going down.
    - improved the availability of the web tier.
        - if web traffic grows rapidly which requires more servers than two => the load balancer can handle adding new servers gracefully => once new servers added to the web server pool, requests will be routed to them automatically by load balancer.
